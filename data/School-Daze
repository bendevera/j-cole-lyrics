Yeah
Take ya'll back... to them school days, yeah.
Fayettenam, what up, man?
We came a long way from sticking move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning
It goes down in the lunch room
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food,
Bust moves to the hallway
My niggas posted on the wall, always
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle
If we had this shit our way
We be standing here all day
But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape.
All late to class with fake passes,
Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing.
They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Damon Dashes
I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes.
Walk straight past my ex and don't speak,
It's all good, probably have a new ex by next week.
I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that,
But what I wouldn't give to go back.
