Gotta get my groove back, you know?
It's been a little minute,
Yea
Yeah
Uh,
Label me greedy, but see me finish what Petey started,
From Carolina where niggas spray like graffiti artists,
The south nigga, niggas used to think we retarded,
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggas. (yea)
I fuck with non rapping niggas, non clapping niggas,
Niggas is real, y'all is action figures. (ha)
Ain't into acting bigger than I really am,
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man.
Where the beef at?
Back in the days I ain't even go out for recess,
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay.
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes,
And niggas GATs got bodies like video hoes.
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow.
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04,
No disrespect to my favorite player,
Niggas praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich,
So I'm slaying niggas, yea.
